Constraints:
When using the R"(...)" form, the raw character sequences inside it cannot be of the form as "( or )" , 
i.e, the opening and closing sequence. Therefore, we cannot have R"( "(hello)" )".
For that, we need to use an additiomal delimiter wrapper around it, so that it is 
R"something( "(hello)" )something".
However, now, we cannot have a character sequence resembling these new opening and closing sequences, 
i.e, "something( or )something"
