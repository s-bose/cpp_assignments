Explain in your own words the meaning of redirection and piping

    > Input/Output Redirection is used in Unix for diverting the input of a command
    from another file, or diverting the output of a command to some other file.

    For example,
    echo hello world > text

    will redirect the output produced by echo (which is "hello world") and write it to the file named text

    Piping is used as another form of redirection where the output of one program (on the left hand side, prog1) is
    used as an input to another program (on the right hand side, prog2).

    prog1 | prog2


In particular, explain what happens in

    program < in > out
        

    > here, program gets its input from the file named in, then the output of the program gets saved in out.

    program | less

    > The output of the program is linked to the input to the unix command less.
